# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation details for the Retail Analytics Platform, including the data processing pipeline, model training, API development, and dashboard creation.

## 1. Data Processing Pipeline

### 1.1 Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process handles:
- Missing values in sales and review data
- Date format standardization
- Outlier detection and handling
- Text normalization for reviews

Implementation:
# src/data/preprocessing.py
def clean_sales_data(data):
    # Handle missing values
    # Convert date columns
    # Remove outliers
    return cleaned_data

def clean_review_data(data):
    # Normalize text
    # Handle missing values
    # Convert date columns
    return cleaned_data

### 1.2 Feature Engineering

Features created for different models:

**Sales Forecasting Features:**
- Time-based features (day of week, month, holidays)
- Lag features (previous day, week, month sales)
- Rolling statistics (7-day, 30-day averages)
- Categorical encodings (store, product, promotion)

**Customer Segmentation Features:**
- Purchase frequency
- Average transaction value
- Total spend
- Recency (days since last purchase)
- Channel preference (online vs in-store ratio)

**Review Analysis Features:**
- Text embeddings
- Sentiment scores
- Feature and attribute extraction
- Rating normalization

Implementation:
# src/data/feature_engineering.py
def create_sales_features(data):
    # Create time features
    # Create lag features
    # Create rolling statistics
    return features

def create_customer_features(data):
    # Calculate purchase metrics
    # Calculate channel preferences
    return features

def create_review_features(data):
    # Extract text features
    # Calculate sentiment scores
    return features

## 2. Model Development

### 2.1 Sales Forecasting

**Model Selection:** XGBoost for its performance with tabular data and ability to handle non-linear relationships.

**Training Process:**
1. Split data into train/validation/test sets
2. Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
3. Feature importance analysis
4. Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²

Implementation:
# src/models/forecasting.py
def train_forecasting_model(data, features, target):
    # Split data
    # Train model
    # Evaluate performance
    return model, feature_importance

def predict_sales(model, future_data, features):
    # Generate predictions
    return predictions

### 2.2 Customer Segmentation

**Model Selection:** K-Means clustering for its simplicity and interpretability.

**Training Process:**
1. Feature scaling
2. Determine optimal number of clusters using silhouette score
3. Train K-Means model
4. Analyze cluster characteristics

Implementation:
# src/models/segmentation.py
def train_segmentation_model(data, features, n_clusters=3):
    # Scale features
    # Train model
    # Analyze clusters
    return model, cluster_centers

def predict_segment(model, customer_data, features):
    # Assign customers to segments
    return segments

### 2.3 Sentiment Analysis

**Model Selection:** Fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment classification.

**Training Process:**
1. Preprocess review text
2. Fine-tune BERT on labeled sentiment data
3. Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

Implementation:
# src/models/sentiment.py
def train_sentiment_model(data, text_column, target_column):
    # Preprocess text
    # Train model
    # Evaluate performance
    return model, vectorizer

def predict_sentiment(model, vectorizer, texts):
    # Generate predictions
    return sentiments

### 2.4 RAG Implementation

**Components:**
1. Document indexing of product reviews and descriptions
2. Query processing
3. Retrieval of relevant documents
4. Generation of answers using Google Gemini API

Implementation:
# src/models/rag.py
def index_documents(documents):
    # Create vector embeddings
    # Build index
    return index

def retrieve_documents(index, query, k=5):
    # Search for relevant documents
    return documents

def generate_answer(query, documents):
    # Generate answer using Gemini API
    return answer

## 3. API Development

### 3.1 API Structure

The API is built using FastAPI with the following components:
- Routers for different functionality areas
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Dependency injection for shared resources
- Authentication middleware
- Rate limiting and caching

Implementation:
# api/main.py
app = FastAPI(title="Retail Analytics API")

# Include routers
app.include_router(forecast_router, prefix="/api/forecast", tags=["Forecasting"])
app.include_router(review_router, prefix="/api/reviews", tags=["Reviews"])
app.include_router(product_router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["Products"])
app.include_router(rag_router, prefix="/api/rag", tags=["RAG"])

### 3.2 API Endpoints

**Forecasting Endpoints:**
- `/api/forecast/sales`: Generate sales forecasts
- `/api/analysis/sales`: Analyze historical sales

**Review Endpoints:**
- `/api/reviews/data`: Get review data
- `/api/reviews/summary`: Get product summaries
- `/api/reviews/feature-sentiment`: Get feature-level sentiment

**Product Endpoints:**
- `/api/products`: List all products
- `/api/products/info`: Get product information
- `/api/products/compare`: Compare products

**RAG Endpoints:**
- `/api/rag/query`: Answer product questions

## 4. Dashboard Development

### 4.1 Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is built using Streamlit with the following pages:
- Home: Overview and KPIs
- Sales Analysis: Detailed sales trends and analysis
- Forecasting: Sales predictions and model metrics
- Customer Segments: Segment profiles and analysis
- Product Reviews: Sentiment analysis and feature insights
- RAG Q&A: Interactive product question answering

Implementation:
# dashboard/app.py
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Retail Analytics Dashboard",
    page_icon="ðŸ“Š",
    layout="wide"
)

# Main dashboard code

### 4.2 Dashboard Components

**Reusable Components:**
- Charts: Sales trends, sentiment distribution, etc.
- Filters: Date range, product, category, etc.
- KPI cards: Metrics and indicators

Implementation:
# dashboard/components/charts.py
def sales_trend_chart(data, date_col, value_col):
    # Create sales trend chart
    return fig

# dashboard/components/filters.py
def create_filter_sidebar(data, date_column, category_columns, numeric_columns):
    # Create filters
    return filtered_data
