# MLOps Design

This document outlines the MLOps architecture for the Retail Analytics Platform, including model training, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.

## Architecture Overview

![MLOps Architecture](images/mlops_architecture.png)

The MLOps architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Data Pipeline**: Ingests, processes, and transforms data for model training
2. **Model Training**: Trains and evaluates machine learning models
3. **Model Registry**: Stores and versions trained models
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploys models to production
5. **Model Monitoring**: Monitors model performance and data drift
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates testing, building, and deployment

## Data Pipeline

### Data Sources

- **Sales Data**: Daily sales transactions from store POS systems
- **Customer Data**: Customer profiles and purchase history
- **Product Reviews**: Customer reviews from e-commerce platform
- **External Data**: Weather data, holidays, economic indicators

### Data Processing

The data processing pipeline uses the following tools:

- **Storage**: AWS S3 for raw and processed data
- **Processing**: Python with pandas for batch processing
- **Orchestration**: Airflow for scheduling and dependency management

### Data Validation

Data validation ensures data quality before model training:

- **Schema Validation**: Ensures data structure consistency
- **Range Checks**: Validates numeric values are within expected ranges
- **Completeness Checks**: Identifies missing values
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual patterns or outliers

Implementation:
# Using Great Expectations for data validation
import great_expectations as ge

def validate_sales_data(data_path):
    context = ge.data_context.DataContext()
    batch = context.get_batch(
        batch_kwargs={"path": data_path, "datasource": "sales_data"},
        expectation_suite_name="sales_data_suite"
    )
    results = batch.validate()
    return results.success

## Model Training

### Training Infrastructure

Model training uses the following infrastructure:

- **Compute**: AWS EC2 instances or SageMaker for training
- **Frameworks**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow for tracking experiments
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna for automated tuning

### Training Workflow

The training workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create features for model training
3. **Model Selection**: Select appropriate algorithm
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance
6. **Model Registration**: Register trained model in registry

Implementation:
# Using MLflow for experiment tracking
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn

def train_model(data, features, target, params):
    mlflow.start_run()

    # Log parameters
    for param_name, param_value in params.items():
        mlflow.log_param(param_name, param_value)

    # Train model
    model = XGBRegressor(**params)
    model.fit(data[features], data[target])

    # Log metrics
    predictions = model.predict(data[features])
    rmse = mean_squared_error(data[target], predictions, squared=False)
    r2 = r2_score(data[target], predictions)

    mlflow.log_metric("rmse", rmse)
    mlflow.log_metric("r2", r2)

    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

    mlflow.end_run()
    return model

### Model Versioning

Models are versioned using MLflow model registry:

- **Model Name**: Identifies the model type (e.g., sales_forecaster)
- **Version**: Incremental version number
- **Stage**: Development, Staging, Production, Archived
- **Description**: Details about the model, features, and performance

## Model Deployment

### Deployment Options

The platform supports multiple deployment options:

- **REST API**: Models deployed as FastAPI endpoints
- **Batch Inference**: Scheduled batch predictions
- **Edge Deployment**: Lightweight models deployed to edge devices

### Deployment Workflow

The deployment workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Model Selection**: Select model version from registry
2. **Environment Preparation**: Create deployment environment
3. **Model Packaging**: Package model with dependencies
4. **Deployment**: Deploy model to target environment
5. **Testing**: Verify deployment with test requests
6. **Traffic Routing**: Route traffic to new model version

Implementation:
# Using FastAPI for model deployment
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
import mlflow.pyfunc

app = FastAPI()

def load_model():
    model_uri = "models:/sales_forecaster/Production"
    model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)
    return model

@app.post("/predict")
def predict(data: dict, model: mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel = Depends(load_model)):
    predictions = model.predict(data)
    return {"predictions": predictions.tolist()}

### A/B Testing

A/B testing compares model versions:

- **Traffic Splitting**: Route percentage of traffic to each model
- **Metrics Collection**: Collect performance metrics for each model
- **Statistical Analysis**: Compare model performance
- **Promotion**: Promote winning model to production

## Model Monitoring

### Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring tracks model accuracy:

- **Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, R², precision, recall, F1 score
- **Thresholds**: Alert thresholds for metric degradation
- **Dashboards**: Grafana dashboards for visualization

### Data Drift Detection

Data drift detection identifies changes in input data:

- **Feature Statistics**: Track mean, median, variance of features
- **Distribution Tests**: KS test, JS divergence for distribution shifts
- **Concept Drift**: Detect changes in relationships between features and target

Implementation:
# Using Evidently for drift detection
from evidently.dashboard import Dashboard
from evidently.dashboard.tabs import DataDriftTab

def detect_drift(reference_data, current_data, features):
    dashboard = Dashboard(tabs=[DataDriftTab()])
    dashboard.calculate(reference_data, current_data, column_mapping=features)

    drift_report = dashboard.get_drift_metrics()
    return drift_report

### Alerting

Alerting notifies team members of issues:

- **Channels**: Email, Slack, PagerDuty
- **Severity Levels**: Info, Warning, Critical
- **Escalation**: Automatic escalation for critical issues

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration ensures code quality:

- **Code Linting**: flake8, black for code style
- **Unit Tests**: pytest for testing components
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency and vulnerability scanning

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery automates deployment:

- **Build Triggers**: Git commits, scheduled builds, manual triggers
- **Environment Promotion**: Dev → Staging → Production
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback on failure
- **Approval Gates**: Manual approval for production deployment

Implementation:
```yaml

## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure is managed using Terraform:

- **AWS Resources**: EC2, S3, RDS, SageMaker
- **Kubernetes**: EKS for container orchestration
- **Networking**: VPC, subnets, security groups
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana

Implementation:
```hcl
# Terraform configuration for AWS resources
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "model_artifacts" {
  bucket = "retail-analytics-model-artifacts"
  acl    = "private"
  
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  
  lifecycle_rule {
    enabled = true
    expiration {
      days = 90
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_sagemaker_model" "sales_forecaster" {
  name               = "sales-forecaster"
  execution_role_arn = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.arn
  
  primary_container {
    image          = "${aws_ecr_repository.model_repo.repository_url}:latest"
    model_data_url = "s3://${aws_s3_bucket.model_artifacts.bucket}/models/sales_forecaster/model.tar.gz"
  }
